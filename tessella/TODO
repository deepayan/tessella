TODO 


Make theme a new class with $ methods. Constructed using theme = tessella.theme().

- theme$default$foo gives something reasonable for all foo

- theme$bar$foo gives theme$bar$foo is non-NULL, otherwise theme$default$foo

This lets us describe theme$bar as only differences (from
theme$default).  The NULL components of bar get affected by changes in
default.
